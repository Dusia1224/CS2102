 * Problem 1: The BMI Sorter

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure that attempts to quantify an individualâ€™s tissue mass. It is commonly collected during annual checkups or clinic visits. It is defined as:
  BMI = weight / ( height * height )
A simplified BMI scale classifies a value below 18.5 as "underweight", a value at least 18.5 but under 25 as "healthy", a value at least 25 but under 30 as "overweight", and a value at least 30 as "obese".
Design a program called bmiReport that consumes a list of personal health records (defined above) and produces a report containing a list of names (not the entire records) of patients in each BMI classification category. The names within each list in the report should be in the same order as in the original list of health records (you may assume that no two people have the same name). Use the BMISummary class in the starter files for the report.

The starter files provide a concrete test case for this method.

In a comment at the bottom of the BMIExamples.java file, identify the subtasks for Problem 1. Your comment will be graded.
